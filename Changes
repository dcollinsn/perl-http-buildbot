Revision history for REST-Buildbot

0.01    August 12, 2016, 20:20 EDT
        Initial releast of REST::Buildbot. Limitations:
        * Error handling is virtually nonexistant
        * There are no public tests because I don't have a public
            enough Buildbot instance to test against
        * Caching some data from the API calls is a TODO
