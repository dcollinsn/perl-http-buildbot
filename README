REST::Buildbot - Interface to the Buildbot v2 REST API

Version 0.02

This is an interface to the REST API provided by Buildbot instances. Most
object types can be fetched by name or id, and most object types can be
used to look up associated objects. The individual objects have no methods,
but do have accessors for all of the data returned by the REST API. Most
attributes are pure perl data types, the only exception is BuildSets and
Changes, both of which have an attribute that contains a
REST::BuildBot::SourceStamp or an arrayref of them.
