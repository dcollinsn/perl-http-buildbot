=head1 NAME

REST::Buildbot - Interface to the Buildbot v2 REST API

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is an interface to the REST API provided by Buildbot instances. Most
object types can be fetched by name or id, and most object types can be
used to look up associated objects. The individual objects have no methods,
but do have accessors for all of the data returned by the REST API. Most
attributes are pure perl data types, the only exception is BuildSets and
Changes, both of which have an attribute that contains a
REST::BuildBot::SourceStamp or an arrayref of them.

    use REST::Buildbot;

    my $bb = REST::Buildbot->new(url => 'http://localhost:8010/api/v2/');

    # Get the 'linux' builder's first build
    my $linux_builder = $bb->get_builder_by_name('linux');
    my $build = $bb->get_build_by_builder_and_number($linux_builder, 1);

    # Learn about this build
    my $buildrequest = $bb->get_buildrequest_by_id($build->buildrequestid);
    my $buildset = $bb->get_buildset_by_id($buildrequest->buildsetid);
    my $sourcestamp = $buildset->sourcestamps->[0];
    # Branch, revision ID, and commit message are in the SourceStamp object

    # Look up all the builds with a certain revision
    my $rev = '0123456789abcdef...';
    my $buildsets = $bb->get_buildsets_by_revision($rev);
    # There may be several, choose in your own way
    my $buildset = $buildsets->[0];
    # Find all the builds on this buildset, and explore some information
    my $buildrequests = $bb->get_buildrequests_by_buildset($bsid);
    foreach my $buildrequest (@$buildrequests) {
        my $brid = $buildrequest->buildrequestid;
        my $builds = $bb->get_builds_by_buildrequest($brid);
        # Again, choose one build. Usually most recent, older ones may
        # be cancels or retries
        my $build = $builds->[0];
        my $steps = $bb->get_steps_by_build($build->buildid);
        # The last step is make test for me
        my $make_test = $steps->[-1];
        my $logs = $bb->get_logs_by_step($make_test->stepid);
        # Choose which log to use - probably by looping and
        # comparing against name
        my $log;
        foreach my $l (@$logs) {
            if ($l->name =~ /stdio/) {
                $log = $l;
                last;
            }
        }
        die "No stdio log" unless $log;

    }

=head1 AVAILABLE METHODS

The following subtypes are available: Build, Builder, BuildRequest,
BuildSet, Change, Log, SourceStamp, Step. Of these, all 8 have an
ID which they can be looked up by, for example, get_build_by_id, or
they can all be looked up at once by, for example, get_builds.

Additionally, Builders can be looked up by name, Changes can be
looked up by revision. These methods use names like
get_builder_by_name.

Builds can also be looked up using the build "number" (which is
unique by builder, but not globally unique - it is distinct from
the build id). This method requires the Builder object and the
build number, and is called get_build_by_builder_and_number.

The objects themselves have a number of interrelationships. Most
of these are one-to-many, even though some of them are one-to-one
under most normal cases. For example, buildset to buildrequest is
expected to be one-to-many (if one scheduler triggers more than
one builder), but usually each buildrequest has only one build.
There may be multiple builds per buildrequest if one of the builds
was cancelled manually or due to a client restart. Here is a full
list of valid relationships:

=over 4

=item Builder to Build
=item Builder to BuildRequest
=item BuildSet to BuildRequest
=item BuildRequest to Build
=item Build to Step
=item Step to Log

=back

Each of the above is a one-to-many relationship. For example,
get_builds_by_builder returns an arrayref of Builds, but
get_builder_by_build returns a single Builder.

Additionally, a Change is one-to-one with a SourceStamp, and
a BuildSet is one-to-many with SourceStamps. Generally, you
will not use this relationship, instead using a helper function
like get_buildsets_by_revision or get_changes_by_revision if
you have a source control revision, or the ->sourcestamp->*
properties of a Change, or the ->sourcestamps->[$i]->*
properties of a BuildSet, to get a source control revision.

Finally, it is possible to get the text of a log object using
get_log_text.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

On error, REST::Buildbot methods will return undef and set an error
string, which can be accessed by ->errorstr. An error is defined as
an LWP::UserAgent error, a lookup by an ID that does not exist, or
calling a method with insufficient or incorrect arguments.

If no items are found for a query, REST::Buildbot will return undef,
for methods returning a single object, or an empty array ref, for
methods potentially returning multiple objects.

=head1 CACHING

REST::Buildbot may cache the results of common calls, such as the
list of all builders. In general, you should assume that data is no
more recent than the first call made against a REST::Buildbot object.
If you wish to ensure that cached data is not being used, for example,
if you are using REST::Buildbot within an application that runs as a
daemon, you should create a new REST::Buildbot object.

=head1 METHODS

=head1 new

Constructor. Takes one mandatory argument, the URL to the API of the
Buildbot instance to use. Should end in /api/v2/.

    my $bb = REST::Buildbot->new(url => 'http://localhost:8010/api/v2/');

=head2 get_*

This set of methods allows lookup of all objects of a given type that
the buildbot instance has. It returns a reference to an array of those
objects. If there are none, it returns an empty array.
